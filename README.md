# KMeansClustering
Segmented social media engagement data into four groups using K-Means clustering with feature scaling and the Elbow Method to identify optimal clusters
Applied K-Means clustering on social media engagement metrics to segment data into four meaningful groups. Utilized StandardScaler for feature scaling and the Elbow Method to identify the optimal cluster count. Developed and trained the K-Means model to uncover distinct engagement patterns.
